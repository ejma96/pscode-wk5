// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

num1

if num1%2==0
print even

else print odd

ask for number
check if number is even
print even, else odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a = num1
b = num2
c = num3
d = num4
e = num5

(a + b + c + d + e)/5 = avg

if a < b
	set max to b
else 
	set max to a

if c > a
	set max to c
if d > a
	set max to d
if e > a
	set max to e

if a > b
	set min to b
else 
	set min to a

if c < a
	set min to c
if d < a
	set min to d
if e < a
	set min to e

print avg
print "Max is"
print max
print "Min is"
print min

ask for 5 numbers
calculate average
calculate max number
calculate min number
print average
print max
print min
